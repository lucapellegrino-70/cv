                            I had the privilege of collaborating within a dedicated team on the development of software tailored for healthcare organizations, including private hospitals and laboratories. In this dynamic role, I spearheaded both the analysis and development phases
                            alongside two other skilled engineers. Our focus was on crafting a robust solution that seamlessly integrated with the intricate needs of healthcare institutions. Leveraging the capabilities of Microsoft Visual Basic 5, coupled
                            with the reliability of Microsoft SQL Server database and the precision reporting of Crystal Reports, we delivered a comprehensive software suite designed to streamline operations and enhance patient care.

                            I had the honor of serving as an instructor for the well known private school 'Informatica Sud' for Basic and Advanced Computer Programming courses. These comprehensive programs delved into a range of foundational and advanced programming languages, including
                            Quick Basic, Turbo Pascal, Clipper and Cobol. Through hands-on instruction and tailored curriculum, students gained proficiency in these languages, equipping them with essential skills for their future endeavors in the realm
                            of computer programming.
